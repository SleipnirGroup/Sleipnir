The system is transcripted by one of three methods (direct
transcription, direct collocation, or single-shooting) and additional
constraints can be added.

In direct transcription, each state is a decision variable constrained
to the integrated dynamics of the previous state. In direct
collocation, the trajectory is modeled as a series of cubic
polynomials where the centerpoint slope is constrained. In single-
shooting, states depend explicitly as a function of all previous
states and all previous inputs.

Explicit ODEs are integrated using RK4.

For explicit ODEs, the function must be in the form dx/dt = f(t, x,
u). For discrete state transition functions, the function must be in
the form xₖ₊₁ = f(t, xₖ, uₖ).

Direct collocation requires an explicit ODE. Direct transcription and
single-shooting can use either an ODE or state transition function.

```
minₓ f(x)
subject to cₑ(x) = 0
           cᵢ(x) ≥ 0
```



where f(x) is the scalar cost function, x is the vector of decision
variables (variables the solver can tweak to minimize the cost
function), cᵢ(x) are the inequality constraints, and cₑ(x) are the
equality constraints. Constraints are equations or inequalities of the
decision variables that constrain what values the solver is allowed to
use when searching for an optimal solution.

The nice thing about this class is users don't have to put their
system in the form shown above manually; they can write it in natural
mathematical form and it'll be converted for them.
