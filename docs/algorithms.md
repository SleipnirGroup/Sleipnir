## Reverse accumulation automatic differentiation

In reverse accumulation AD, the dependent variable to be differentiated is fixed and the derivative is computed with respect to each subexpression recursively. In a pen-and-paper calculation, the derivative of the outer functions is repeatedly substituted in the chain rule:

(∂y/∂x) = (∂y/∂w₁) ⋅ (∂w₁/∂x) = ((∂y/∂w₂) ⋅ (∂w₂/∂w₁)) ⋅ (∂w₁/∂x) = ...

In reverse accumulation, the quantity of interest is the adjoint, denoted with a bar (w̄); it is a derivative of a chosen dependent variable with respect to a subexpression w: ∂y/∂w.

Given the expression f(x₁,x₂) = sin(x₁) + x₁x₂, the computational graph is:

The operations to compute the derivative:

w̄₅ = 1 (seed)<br>
w̄₄ = w̄₅(∂w₅/∂w₄) = w̄₅<br>
w̄₃ = w̄₅(∂w₅/∂w₃) = w̄₅<br>
w̄₂ = w̄₃(∂w₃/∂w₂) = w̄₃w₁<br>
w̄₁ = w̄₄(∂w₄/∂w₁) + w̄₃(∂w₃/∂w₁) = w̄₄cos(w₁) + w̄₃w₂
