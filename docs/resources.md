## Convex optimization

Visually Explained's _Convex Optimization_ video series provides geometric intuition for convex optimization and the interior-point method.

Sleipnir's authors learned numerical optimization from the following book and relied heavily upon it to implement Sleipnir.

See [internal algorithms](https://sleipnirgroup.github.io/Sleipnir/md_docs_2algorithms.html) for derivations of Newton's method (unconstrained optimization), sequential quadratic programming (optimization with equality constraints), and interior-point method (optimization with equality and inequality constraints). The bottom of that page lists works cited by Sleipnir's internals.
